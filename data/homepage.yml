      Have an extra domain lying around, why not make something light and a more casual portfolio page.

    <p>
      When I was a kid, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was really popular that time. <br>
      Wanted to be a professional skater but I landed a 360 flip and became a developer instead.(See what I did there?)
    </p>
    <p>
      I study and follow programming trends that people want to hire for.
    </p>
    <p>Props to <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/TheJackForge'>Jack</a> for the job title, this <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme'>theme</a> is one of those pulled codes. Thank you Radity!</p>
    <p>Welcome, have a look around and pleased to meet you!</p>"

  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was
    full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
    good for all of you.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
    leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.

    <p>
    I'm currently working as a Freelance Web Developer, I'm happy and lucky to find freelance work for any gaps in my work history.
    </p>
    <p>
    Over 10+ years of experience working with companies and clients from all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    I've been around for a while to adapt to any new flavor of the month technology.
    </p>
    <p>
    As this great comment I read from a <a target='_blank' href='https://dev.to/degesis/comment/fp7f'>dev.to article</a> said</p>
    <p>
    "Frameworks are like cars, everyone argues that certain brand is the best but learning to drive is what matters."
    </p>
    <p>
    At the end of the day these frameworks and libraries end up as html and javascript codes.
    </p>
    <p>
    I really don't pass technical exams that much and I can say my luck cooperates with me to get into the companies listed.
